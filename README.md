You might have seen the app where you type the food item name and the app will show you the micro-nutrients in it like Calories, Carbs, Fats, Proteins etc.

This app is a demo to show by just clicking a picture of the food item you will get to know the calories, carbs etc.

This classifier is running on the phone so internet is not must and off-course its fast.

I have used tensorflow by google to train this classifier and tflite to optimize model which can inference on mobile without internet.
