Ever used an app where you type in the name of a food item to get its nutritional values like calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins?

This app takes it one step further — simply click a photo of the food, and the app will instantly display its estimated macro-nutrient breakdown.

✅ No internet required – The food classifier runs entirely on-device, ensuring fast and private predictions.
⚙️ Built with TensorFlow – Trained using TensorFlow by Google and optimized with TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for smooth, efficient inference on mobile devices.

This is a demo app to showcase how AI and machine learning can simplify calorie tracking with just your phone’s camera.
